    "## Questions About Data\n",
    "1. There are 2946 fossil recors in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There have been 614 fossils identified to genus-level only.\n",
    "   There have been 2107 fossils identified to species-level only. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are 211 unique accepted names in the dataset.  \n",

    "## Questions About PyRate\n",
    "1. We can change the sampeling of frequency of our PyRate run by running the -s flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The -n flag indicates the number of desired steps in an MCMC chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions About PyRate Output\n",
    "1. The canid_occ_1_marginal_rates.log file is a tab-separated table with the posterior samples of the marginal rates of speciation, extinction, and net diversification, calculated within 1 time unit (typically Myr). \n",
    "2. The canid_occ_1_mcmc.log file is a tab-separated table with the MCMC samples of the posterior, prior, likelihoods of the preservation process and of the birth-death (indicated by PP_lik and BD_lik, respectively), the preservation rate (q_rate), the shape parameter of its gamma-distributed heterogeneity (alpha), the number of sampled rate shifts (k_birth, k_death), the time of origin of the oldest lineage (root_age), the total branch length (tot_length), and the times of speciation and extinction of all taxa in the data set (\\_TS* and \\_TE, respectively). When using the TPP model of preservation, the preservation rates between shifts are indicated as *q_0, q_1, ... q_n (from older to younger).\n",
    "3. The canid_occ_1_sum.txt file is a text file providing the complete list of settings used in the analysis."
